"@spectrum-css/combobox": minor

Combobox now includes a `read-only` state. Add the `is-readOnly` class to the Combobox to enable this feature. By doing so, this also activates the `readonly` attribute in the `Textfield` component. To ensure the intended user experience please make sure the readonly state in the textfield is enabled by adding the `is-readOnly` class and `readonly` attribute on the input element for this component as well.
