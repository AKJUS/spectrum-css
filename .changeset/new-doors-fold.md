Combobox now includes a `read-only` state. Add the `is-readOnly` class to the Combobox to enable this feature. To ensure the intended user experience, please make sure the readonly state in the textfield is enabled by adding the `is-readOnly` class and `readonly` attribute on the input element for this component as well.
