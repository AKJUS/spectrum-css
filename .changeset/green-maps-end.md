Adds the ability to disable text wrapping within the button component's label by applying the class `.spectrum-Button--noWrap` to `.spectrum-Button`.

If the text is longer than the button container an ellipsis `...` indicator will show. Please adjust text length and `max-inline-size` of the button container.
