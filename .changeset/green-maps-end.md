"@spectrum-css/button": minor

Adds the ability to disable text wrapping within the button component's label by applying the class `.spectrum-Button--noWrap` to `.spectrum-Button`. If the text overflows the maximum allowed width of the button, an ellipsis `...` indicator will show. Please note that this option is not a part of the design specification and should be used carefully, with consideration of this overflow behavior and the readability of the button's content.
